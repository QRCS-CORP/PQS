Introduction</h1>
<p>The Post Quantum Shell (PQS) project implements a secure, post-quantum key exchange protocol based on a one-way trust model. In this model, the client trusts the server, and a single shared secret is securely established between them. PQS is designed for efficiency, using the Simplex exchange that is both fast and lightweight while providing 256-bit post-quantum security. This ensures robust protection against future quantum-based threats.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="protocol_sec"></a>
Protocol Description</h1>
<p>The PQS exchange is a one-way trust, client-to-server key-exchange model in which the client trusts the server, and a single shared secret is securely shared between them. Designed for efficiency, the Simplex exchange is fast and lightweight, while providing 256-bit post-quantum security. This protocol is versatile and can be used in a wide range of applications, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Client registration on networks</li>
<li>Secure cloud storage</li>
<li>Hub-and-spoke model communications</li>
<li>Commodity trading</li>
<li>Electronic currency exchange</li>
</ul>
<p>Essentially, PQS is applicable to any scenario where an encrypted tunnel using strong, quantum-safe cryptography is required.</p>
<p>The server in this model is implemented as a multi-threaded communications platform capable of generating a uniquely keyed encrypted tunnel for each connected client. With a lightweight state footprint of less than 4 kilobytes per client, a single server instance can handle potentially hundreds of thousands of simultaneous connections. The cipher encapsulation keys used during each key exchange are ephemeral and unique, ensuring that every key exchange remains secure and independent of previous sessions.</p>
<p>The server distributes a public signature verification key to its clients. This key is used to authenticate the server's public cipher encapsulation key during the key exchange process. The public verification key can be securely distributed via various channels, such as during a registration event, pre-embedded in client software, or through other secure methods.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="crypto_sec"></a>
Cryptographic Primitives</h1>
<p>PQS relies on a suite of cryptographic primitives designed to be resilient against both classical and quantum-based attacks. These primitives form the foundation for PQS's encryption, key exchange, and authentication processes.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="asym_sec"></a>
Asymmetric Cryptographic Primitives</h2>
<p>PQS employs post-quantum secure asymmetric algorithms to ensure both the integrity and confidentiality of key exchanges, as well as to enable robust digital signature functionality. The primary asymmetric primitives used include:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Kyber:</b> An IND-CCA secure lattice-based key encapsulation mechanism that provides secure and efficient key exchange resistant to quantum attacks. Kyber is highly valued for its balance between computational speed and cryptographic strength.</li>
<li><b>McEliece:</b> A code-based cryptosystem that leverages the difficulty of decoding general linear codes, offering strong security even against advanced quantum decryption techniques.</li>
<li><b>Dilithium:</b> A lattice-based digital signature scheme based on MLWE and MSIS problems, providing fast signing and verification while maintaining robust security guarantees against quantum attacks.</li>
<li><b>Sphincs+</b>: A stateless hash-based signature scheme that delivers long-term security without reliance on specific problem structures, ensuring resilience against future cryptographic advancements.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="sym_sec"></a>
Symmetric Cryptographic Primitives</h2>
<p>PQS employs the Rijndael Cryptographic Stream (RCS) for symmetric encryption. RCS is an adaptation of the AES symmetric cipher, modified to meet post-quantum security requirements. Key features of RCS include:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Wide-Block</b> Cipher Design: Extends the original AES design by increasing the block size (from 128 to 256 bits) and the number of transformation rounds (from 14 to 21 for a 256-bit key, and 30 rounds for a 512-bit key), thereby enhancing resistance to differential and linear cryptanalysis.</li>
<li><b>Enhanced</b> Key Schedule: Utilizes a strong key expansion function based on Keccak (cSHAKE) to generate keys that are resistant to algebraic, differential, and other forms of cryptanalysis.</li>
<li><b>Authenticated</b> Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD): Integrates with KMAC (a Keccak-based Message Authentication Code) to provide both encryption and message authentication in a single operation, ensuring data integrity alongside confidentiality.</li>
</ul>
<p>RCS is optimized for high-performance environments and leverages AES-NI instructions present in modern CPUs.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="hash_sec"></a>
Hash Functions and Key Derivation</h2>
<p>Hash functions and key derivation functions (KDFs) are critical in transforming raw cryptographic data into secure keys and hashes. The primitives employed in PQS include:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>SHA-3</b>: Serves as the primary hash function for PQS, providing secure, collision-resistant hashing.</li>
<li><b>SHAKE:</b> A Keccak-based extendable output function (XOF) used for deriving symmetric keys from shared secrets, ensuring each session key is uniquely generated and unpredictable.</li>
<li><b>KMAC:</b> A SHA-3-based keyed hashing function that provides post-quantum resistant message authentication.</li>
</ul>
